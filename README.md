# Modpack Installation Repository

This repository is dedicated to hosting the mods required for our custom launcher.  
It will be updated each time a new modpack is released for our adventure with friends.

## Purpose
- Provide an easy way to download and install the mods for our launcher.
- Keep the modpack up to date for everyone involved.
- Share resources with friends during our adventure.

## Future Plans
When the adventure comes to an end, I will consider making the world map available for download as well.
